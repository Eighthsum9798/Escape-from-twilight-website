        <h2> About me</h2>
        
    <p>my name is Gavin James Cook and I am rather new to the development of the industry, I’m 18 years old and have had games be a part of my life for years like destiny 1 and <sub>2</sub>. I have always been a great believer in video games and the good that they can bring, so that’s why I’m happy to be developing games to be enjoyed by others like me.</p>
